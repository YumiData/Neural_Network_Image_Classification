## Data Description
The train folder contains 25,000 images of dogs and cats. Each image in this folder has the label as part of the filename. The test folder contains 12,500 images, named according to a numeric id. For each image in the test set, you should predict a probability that the image is a dog (1 = dog, 0 = cat).

## Project Goals
The goal of this project is to explore modern techniques in image classification and practice new methods on a familiar dataset. While Dogs vs. Cats may seem like a solved problem, the intention is to encourage the application of cutting-edge techniques to pave the way for addressing future challenges in machine learning.
